                        Hi there, we’re GCloud Pvt Ltd (ABN 11 119 159 741) of Level 7, 180 Flinders St, 
                        Melbourne, 3000, Australia (GCloud”) and welcome to our privacy policy which also 
                        applies to our Affiliate Companies. This policy sets out how we handle your personal 
                        information if you’re an GCloud user or visitor to our Sites. It applies across 
                        GCloud Elements, GCloud Market, GCloud Twenty20, GCloud Studio, GCloud Sites, GCloud 
                        Tuts+ and Placeit (the “Sites”).

                        When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘GCloud’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.

                    <li>
                        If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re 
                        talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each 
                        product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.

                    <li>
                        We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you navigate 
                        through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated with the Sites.
                    </li>

                        We collect your personal information when you provide it to us when you complete membership registration 
                        and buy or provide items or services on our Sites, subscribe to a newsletter, email list, submit feedback,

                        As the operator of digital content marketplaces, we have a legitimate interest in verifying the identity of 
                        our authors. We believe that knowing who our authors are will strengthen the integrity of our marketplaces
                         by reducing fraud, making authors more accountable for their content and giving Envato and customers the 
                         ability to enforce contracts for authors who break the rules. Envato also has certain legal obligations 
                         that require us to know who our authors are in certain circumstances. In light of this, if you are an author 
                         we will verify your identity, in particular, your name, full address and date of birth by asking you to show 
                         us a Photo ID document. The verification procedure is called Envato Verify. Envato Verify will be carried 
                         out by our service provider Jumio Corporation located at 395 Page Mill Road, Suite 150, Palo Alto, California,
                          USA. As part of Envato Verify, you will be asked to take a selfie which will then be compared against your 
                          Photo ID document using facial recognition technology. We will use your Photo ID document solely to carry 
                          out Envato Verify and delete it after the completion of this process.

                                detection information, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, fraud warnings 
                                from service providers like identity verification service. We also receive information about you and 
                                your activities on and off the Envato platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and 
                                interactions from our partner ad networks. We also receive information about you as a rights holder 
                                from our third party authors. For example, information in the form of a model release when your image
